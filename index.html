                    <p>Absolutely amazing services. We requested grass cutting, lawn cleanup, and debris removal. Kamran, Muhammad and Jonathan were very professional, punctual of time, went above and beyond to finish the job on time. Trustworthy professional men provided the service as promised and I would definitely recommend them and will be requesting services from them in near future.</p>

                    <p>Our yard looked overgrown and downtrodden before Kam arrived. He showed up the day after I called without judging us and took notes on all of the issues we wanted taken care of and how we wanted it done. After agreeing on a price and the scope of work, he and his employee got right to work. They removed weeds, cleared leaves and trimmed our bushes and monkey grass. It was a huge job. Then, they laid fresh mulch for us. It looks so nice now and already our neighbors have been commenting about how great our landscaping looks! We would love to use Kam and Sophia Landscaping again!</p>

                    <p>Just recently, I was looking for someone to handle some yard work of removing weeds around my tree and bushes,and even some rocks and weeds along the side my driveway. Of the many calls that I made to find a contractor, I found Kam. Kam was reasonably priced, quick, and thorough. He was even available to come out to do the job the next day. I'm so glad that I found Kam, as he saved me many hours of doing this myself. Thank you so much!</p>
